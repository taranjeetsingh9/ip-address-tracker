# IP address tracker

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this.

## The challenge

## IP Address Tracker

This project is an IP Address Tracker application that allows users to track the geographical location of an IP address. The application utilizes the IP Geolocation API by IPify to obtain location data based on the provided IP address.

## Map Generation

In this project, the map generation is accomplished using the Google Maps API. This decision was made due to the flexibility and extensive documentation provided by the Google Maps API, allowing for seamless integration of the map into the application and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size<br>
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page<br>
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load<br>
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location<br>

## Languages Used

This project is built using the following languages:

**HTML:** Used for creating the structure and content of the web pages.<br>
**CSS:** Utilized for styling the HTML elements and enhancing the visual presentation.<br>
**JavaScript:** Employed for adding interactivity and functionality to the web application.<br>

## Concepts Applied

Throughout the development of this project, the following concepts were applied:

**API Integration:** Integrated the IP Geolocation API by IPify to fetch location data based on the provided IP address. <br>
**Google Maps API:** Utilized the Google Maps API for generating and displaying the map interface within the application.<br>
**Form Handling:** Implemented form handling in JavaScript to capture user input (IP address) and initiate the location tracking process.<br>
**DOM Manipulation:** Leveraged JavaScript for dynamically updating the content and behavior of the web page in response to user actions.<br>
**Responsive Design:** Ensured that the application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.<br>
**Error Handling:** Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage invalid inputs and failed API requests, providing a smooth user experience.<br>
**Version Control:** Utilized version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate on the project efficiently.<br>
