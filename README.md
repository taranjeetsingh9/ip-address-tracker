IP-Geolocation-Tracker is a handy tool that fetches detailed location info for any IP address or domain. It uses the IP Geolocation API by IPify and LeafletJS to show you where your own IP is located and lets you search for other locations. It's easy to use, works well on any device, and gives you all the info you need about IP locations..
